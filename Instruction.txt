The folder contains the python files and the sources needed. To execute the program, open and run the files "image_compression.py" and "audio.py", respectively regarding part one and two of the Homework. The images will pop up as Python figure.

Please open in the IDE the directory Gaudino_GrivetTalocia_HW3 before running the program (There are some paths referring to the parent directory)

The other two python files ("test_audio.py" and "test_pnnr.py") are only used for testing the program to create the graphs, you don't need to open or run them.
When you tun the file, in the directory the program will save the audio files.
